# Analysing Employee Performance for Hr Analytics
I leveraged Python and pandas to analyze an employee dataset. My objective was to evaluate the data, address business challenges, and extract valuable insights regarding employee performance.

Using Python's capabilities, I preprocessed the dataset, ensuring data quality and optimizing performance. Through data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and aggregation, I generated meaningful metrics and identified trends, patterns, and correlations.

To effectively communicate my findings, I created visualizations and reports that summarized the insights. This aided stakeholders in understanding the data and making data-driven decisions to improve HR processes and employee performance.
