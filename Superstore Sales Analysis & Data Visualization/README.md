# My Superstore Sales Analysis & Data Visualization Project
I analyzed a real-world Superstore dataset to gain insights and solve business problems. The dataset provided information about sales in a Superstore, allowing me to evaluate the data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. Throughout the project, I performed data pre-processing to ensure data quality, handled null values, removed duplicates, transformed data types, and validated the data for further analysis.

## Key Objectives

#### 1. Data Pre-processing
        (a) Handled null values: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
        (b) Deleted or transformed irrelevant values: Removed or transformed values that were not relevant or meaningful for analysis.
        (c) Transformed data types: Converted data types of specific columns as required.
        (d) Removed duplicates: Identified and eliminated duplicate records while retaining the first occurrence of each unique value.
        (e) Validated the data: Validated the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        (a) Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
        (b) Analyzed the distribution of variables, identified correlations, and detected patterns.
        (c) Generated summary statistics and visualizations to understand the data better.
        
#### 3. Business Problem Solving
        (a) Used the dataset to solve specific business problems and answer relevant questions.
        (b) Applied data analysis techniques to derive insights and make informed decisions.
        (c) Explored relationships between variables and identified factors affecting sales performance.
        
## Results and Insights
Superstore Sales Analysis project aimed to provide valuable insights and solutions to business problems based on the provided dataset. By performing data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization, I uncovered patterns, trends, and correlations within the dataset. The insights derived from this analysis enabled me to make informed business decisions, optimize sales performance, and identify opportunities for improvement.
