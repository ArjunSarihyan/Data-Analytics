# Analyzing User Behavior on Instagram
This project aimed to analyze a dataset of user behavior on Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms. The dataset included information about users, their posts, comments, likes, and other relevant details. By leveraging Python's data processing and analysis capabilities, we cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extracted meaningful insights to understand user behavior on Instagram.

## Key Objectives

#### 1. Data Cleaning
        (a) Handled missing data, removed duplicates, and corrected inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.
        (b) Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for further analysis.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        (a) Gained a deep understanding of the dataset by examining features, distributions, correlations, and patterns.
        (b) Generated summary statistics and visualizations to identify trends, popular user behaviors, and other key insights.
        

#### 3. User Analysis
        (a) Identified the 5 oldest users in the dataset.
        (b) Determined the day of the week when most users registered on Instagram.
        
#### 4. User Engagement Analysis
        (a) Identified users who had never posted a photo and targeted them with an email campaign.
        (b) Determined the user who received the most likes on a single photo, indicating the winner of the contest.
        
#### 5. User Posting Analysis
        (a) Calculated the average number of posts per user (total number of photos divided by the total number of users).
        (b) Ranked users based on their posting frequency (higher to lower).
        (c) Determined the total number of posts by each user.

#### 6. Hashtag Analysis
        (a) Identified the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on Instagram.

#### 7. User Activity Analysis
        (a) Found users who liked every single photo on the site, indicating potential bot activity.
        (b) Identified users who had never commented on a photo, potentially indicating celebrity accounts.

#### 8. User Engagement Percentage
        (a) Calculated the percentage of users who had either never commented or had commented on every photo.

## Results and Insights
I aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of user behavior on Instagram. The insights derived from this analysis can be utilized to make data-driven decisions, such as optimizing ad campaigns, targeting inactive users, identifying popular hashtags, and addressing issues related to bot activity or celebrity accounts. Additionally, understanding user preferences, posting patterns, and engagement levels can help improve user satisfaction, drive user engagement, and enhance the overall user experience on Instagram.
