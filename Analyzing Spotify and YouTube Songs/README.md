# Analyzing Spotify and YouTube Songs Using Python
During this project, I worked with a real-world dataset that combined data from Spotify and YouTube. The dataset contained information about songs, albums, engagement metrics, and other relevant details. My goal was to clean and preprocess the dataset, perform insightful analysis, and extract valuable information to understand trends and patterns in song popularity and engagement.

## Key Objectives

        (b) Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for further analysis.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        (a) Gained a deep understanding of the dataset by examining features, distributions, correlations, and patterns.
        
#### 3. Popularity of Song Tracks
        (a) By identifying the most viewed song track on YouTube, I gained an understanding of the song's popularity and reach among YouTube users. 
        (b) Similarly, determining the most streamed song track on Spotify helped me gauge its popularity and listener engagement on the platform.
        
#### 4. Energy-Liveness Ratio
        (a) The analysis of the energy-liveness ratio allowed me to identify songs with high energy and liveliness, indicating their potential appeal to listeners seeking energetic and             lively music experiences.
        
#### 5. Black Eyed Peas
        (a) For Black Eyed Peas, the comparison of engagement levels on Spotify and YouTube provided valuable insights into the platforms where their songs resonated more with the                   audience. 
        (b) This information can help them focus their efforts and resources accordingly.

#### 6. Hashtag Analysis
        (a) Identified the top 5 most commonly used hashtags on Instagram.

#### 7. Gorillaz
        (a) Gorillaz's most liked song on YouTube, along with the energy and tempo metrics, offered insights into the characteristics of their popular songs and helped understand the               preferences of their YouTube audience.

#### 8. Prominent Album Types
        (a) Analyzing the prominent album types on Spotify provided an understanding of the types of albums that attracted more listeners, enabling artists and music platforms to align             their offerings with user preferences.

## Results and Insights
I aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of song popularity and engagement on Spotify and YouTube. By cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, I ensured the integrity of the data for accurate analysis. The insights derived from this analysis are utilized by artists, music platforms, and industry professionals to make informed decisions about marketing, promotions, and content creation strategies.
